          <p>Like several parts of the world, especially Europe, India has been experiencing a massive surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths. As of April 10, 2021, India is the 3rd leading country based on the USA and Brazil's identified cases. Since the middle of March 2021, the second wave has started, and on April 09, the highest number of cases (144,829) has been identified in India. The major affected states are Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Despite this high caseload, several national movements such as the farmers' movement, election in several states have been going on. Those can increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19.
