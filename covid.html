                    <h2 style="color: rgb(68, 68, 119);">Implications of the second wave of COVID-19 in India</h2>
                    <p>The second wave of COVID-19 in India has had severe consequences in the form of spiralling cases, 
                        reduced supplies of essential treatments, and increased deaths particularly in the young population. 
                        Understanding why the second wave has been more dangerous than the first could help to identify the 
                        potential areas of diagnostics to target with future control strategies
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the second wave in India, many cases of mucormycosis, also known as the black fungus, 
                        have been reported in patients with diabetes and patients with COVID-19, as well as patients 
                        who were recovering from infection. The excessive use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 
                        and immunosuppression by the virus led to the emergence of this opportunistic fungal infection. 
                        Although cases of black fungus were reported during the first wave, cases during the second wave 
                        have become more prominent in many cities of India, leading state governments to declare this too 
                        as an epidemic. As of June 7, 2021, the Indian Ministry of Health had recorded 28 252 cases of black 
                        fungus. The risk of the white fungus Aspergillosis assumed to be even more fatal than the black fungus 
                        is also on the rise with some cases reported in parts of India.

                <p>Patients in the first wave infected with SARS-CoV-2 were predominantly older than 60 years and those
                   with comorbid conditions were at increased risk of death. However, surprisingly, younger adults appear 
                   to be prone to infection during this latest cycle and many patients have died at a young age, including 
                   patients aged between 25 and 50 years
                </p>
                <p>The reason why the younger population is now more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 is not apparent and beyond 
                    current scientific explanations. However, an important observation as the situation develops is that 
                    every individual appeared to have equal risk of being infected with the virus, but the ability to 
                    sustain and overcome infection was variable among individuals. Some people with presumed suboptimal 
                    immune responses could survive, and some individuals, despite having presumed stronger immunity, could 
                    not overcome the rapid infection. A further observation in the peak of the second wave was the sudden 
                    decrease in the oxygen saturation of some patients, even when they were recovering well, giving less 
                    time for the proper ventilation support. This situation created fear and panic among patients and family 
                    members as there was uncertainty around whether the patients would survive the viral infection even when 
                    showing signs of recovery. No answers are available as to why individuals respond differently to SARS-CoV-2 
                    infection. Many reasons could be behind this observation. One explanation could be the presence of different
                     strains of the SARS-CoV-2 that infect individuals simultaneously, with some variants more pathogenic than 
                     others. India's poor air quality index could be a potential factor as to why spread of the infection has 
                     been severe across the country. Comunian and colleagues reported that an increase in fine particulate matter 
                     is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 infection.8 Given that nine of the 15 most polluted cities 
                     globally are in India, it could be postulated that the ability of the Indian population to fight against 
                     COVID-19 is impaired because people's lungs are severely affected by the air pollution. A further reason 
                     could be the presence of different immune responses among individuals; and someone who appears healthy might 
                     not have a strong or potent enough response with regard to immunity. However, absence of scientific studies 
                     on individual immune responses limits our reasoning for this hypothesis.

                            <li>Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.</li>
                            <li>Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
                            <li>Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.</li>
                            <li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
                            <li>Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.</li>
                            <li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
                            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify; margin:10px;">If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; margin:10px;"><u>Masks</u></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify; margin:10px;">Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
